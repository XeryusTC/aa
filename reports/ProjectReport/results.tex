\section{Results}
A schedule that was generated by the system can be found in
\autoref{app:schedule}. As can be seen in this schedule, there are no
conflicts in that no room is allocated twice in the same timeslot and no
lecturer has to give two lectures at the same time. We can also see that
all the groups of students fit into the rooms\footnote{The sizes for the
    rooms can be found on
    \url{https://github.com/XeryusTC/aa/blob/master/locations.yaml} and the
    sizes of the groups of students on
    \url{https://github.com/XeryusTC/aa/blob/master/teachers.yaml}}.

However, the system failed in that it did not schedule a lecture for
Computational Cognitive Neuroscience by Marieke van Vugt. If we look at
the schedule, we can see that every time that there is a room left in a
time slot, we can see that Marieke van Vugt is already scheduled to give a 
lecture. Since she is not able to be at two locations at once, it is not 
possible to schedule a second lecture at this time.
